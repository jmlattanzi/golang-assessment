# Assessment

This project uses an external PostgreSQL database. Connection to this DB is made through a file called `config.json` in the root of this project. If you would like to use your own PostgreSQL database, put the connection url in the `config.json` with the key `DBURL`, or contact me for the config file. You can email me at jonathanlattanzi@gmail.com
